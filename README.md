# physicsTest
A test project of mine. You need processing 1.5.1 or later to make it work.
This was a project when I was starting to learn code so that I could make games out of it.
# How it works
If you have the variable "ifAnimated" on true, then it will do it automatically. Or else you will do it.
"Click the mouse or hit keys to make it move."
